How to Use the Simple Test Cases:

1. Copy `test' directory into your home directory by

$ cp -r test ~/

2. Copy YOUR MODIFIED `shell.c' into the test directory by

$ cp shell.c ~/test/

3. Compile your `shell.c' in test directory, you can use
makefile if you like, or simply use

$ gcc -g shell.c -o mysh 

Now, if there is no error, you can begin to test your small
shell, ;-).

$ ./mysh

* Simple Test Cases

----
COMMAND-> mv readme help 
Output: The `readme' file in the `test' directory should be
renamed into `help'.
----

----
COMMAND-> cat help 
Output: The content of this file should be printed onto the
screen.
----

----
COMMAND-> ./mysh
Output: Start a second `mysh' shell in the first `mysh' shell.
The command prompt should be waiting for user's input.  When 
you press `Ctrl+d', you should go back into your first `mysh', 
still having a "COMMAND-> " waiting for input.

* NOTES

If your small shell can pass the above three test cases, 
congratulations!  You already have a good start point for lab2 & 3.  
Remember, I have some hard test cases for grading purpose, so 
before you submit your program, test it with more cases.  ;-).

Hint: We usually judge whether a program is good or not by three
criteria,
o Correctness
o Performance (in a real system)
o Readability
Therefore, if your program works, try to improve its performance.
If its performance is good, add enough comments if you have
time to improve the readability.

Thank you.
